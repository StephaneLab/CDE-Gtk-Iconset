# CDE-Gtk-Iconset
This a sub-iconset to provide some CDE icons to PCManFM. Iconset originates from CDE desktop and have been brought  in .png format by Arenyart (Andrew Enyart, USA). See https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1120392/ for the original theme. Mainly copied icons and renamed some others to be freedesktop compliant. Modified the theme script to work with Gtk apps. The result is ok for the icons but the navigating arrows are not ok.
