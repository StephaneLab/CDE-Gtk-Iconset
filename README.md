# CDE-Gtk-Iconset
This a sub-iconset to provide some CDE icons to PCManFM. Iconset originates from CDE desktop and have been brought  in .png format by Arenyart (Andrew Enyart, USA). See https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1120392/ for the original theme. Mainly copied icons and renamed some others to be freedesktop compliant. Modified the theme script to work with Gtk apps. The result is ok for the icons but the navigating arrows are not ok.

Changelog :
I have made some simple navigating arrows that are quite acceptable and made some consistant work on the icons name and folders. 
I may work very well with pcmanfm and suits your icewm menu if you use names according to FreeDesktop icons naming,
see : https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html

I have used icewm-menu-fdo to create my menu, it respect FreeDesktop naming but to me it creates too long paths to get to an application.
So I simplified the config file by hand. It's quite easy to get something really efficient.

You will also find some XPM icons to put in your ~/.icewm/icons directory to enhance your icewm menu.
